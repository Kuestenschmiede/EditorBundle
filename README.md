# con4gis EditorBundle
## Overview
The con4gis EditorBundle is an extension of the con4gis MapsBundle.
It enables a frontend editing tool, which can be used to draw different geometries 
onto a map.

__Main features include:__
* Drawing of single points, line strings, polygons, circles and custom geometries via the freehand draw mode.
* Custom styling of the different draw styles
* Semantic categorization of your different draw styles
* Serverside persistence of the drawn elements
* The editor uses projects to group map elements. These projects also appear in the starboard and can be switched as they were defined in the backend.
